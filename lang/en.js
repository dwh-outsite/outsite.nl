    text: `Outsite is the part of DWH (Delftse Werkgroep Homoseksualiteit) specially for LGBT+ youth. We are there for
      everybody who identifies as such. As a society we organise all kinds of activities, ranging from drinks every
      Thursday night and quarterly LGBT+ parties to trips to other cities where we go out together.<br>
      <br>
      These activities are all organized by our fantastic committees and members! The best way to become acquainted with
      Outsite is to take part in the introduction groups (which we call KMGs) or through the use of the bar buddy
      system: Where we will make sure there is someone ready to show you around and who could introduce you to others.`,
